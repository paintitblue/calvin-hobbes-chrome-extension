# calvin-hobbes-chrome-extension
A Chrome Extension built to show a daily Calvin &amp; Hobbes Strip upon opening a tab

An ajax call is used to get the daily comic from http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes. The date is displayed above the comic and the background is randomized. Each background image is positioned uniquely for the most optimal aesthetics such that resizing has minimal effects. The background image changes every 30 seconds or on a mouse click.
